# Rivhit journal Excel import contract

One-time migration input: Rivhit's printed journal "ספר תקבולים תשלומים – יומן קליטה" saved as `.xlsx`, one file per
declaration month. This is the format of the six sample files (months 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 of 2026; 220 rows), checked
against the real files on 2 October 2026. The files hold real client data: never copy names, IDs or amounts into code,
tests or docs. Tests use synthetic grids from `telegram-web/test/excel-journal-fixture.mjs`.

## Reading the workbook

- The workbook has two sheets, `גיליון2` (data, first in the workbook) and `גיליון1` (empty). Pick the sheet by name
  `גיליון2`; if it is missing, take the only sheet that has cells; otherwise reject the file.
- All cells are text, except the date column, which is a real Excel date (serial number, e.g. `46023` = 2026-01-01).
  The reader adapter converts it to `YYYY-MM-DD`; the parser accepts either a serial number or an ISO string.
- `telegram-web/excel-journal-reader.js` does this: it checks the ZIP signature (SheetJS otherwise parses any bytes as
  text), anchors the range at `A1` and keeps dates as serial numbers.
- The reader returns a grid `rows[rowIndex][colIndex]` (0-based) with empty cells as `""`. The parser never touches
  the xlsx library.
- Text cells may carry U+200F (RLM) and spaces. Trim every text cell. Labels are matched on trimmed text.

## Layout (1-based Excel coordinates)

| Area | Position | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Print header | `C3`, `K3`, `C4` | print timestamp, title, page info; ignored |
| Declaration month | `K5` | `לחודש M/YYYY`; a suggestion only |
| Column labels | row 9 (`F9`, `G9`), row 10 | `אסמכ' 2`, `אסמכ' 1`; `סטטוס`, `מע"מ`, `ללא מע"מ`, `כולל מע"מ`, `פרטים`, `חשבון נגדי`, `קוד מיון`, `שורה`, `תאריך` |
| Data | row 11 onward, odd rows only | one transaction per row; even rows are empty spacers |
| Footer | after the last data row | see below |

Locate things by label, not by fixed offsets: find the header row by `סטטוס` in column A, the data by rows with a
date in column N, the footer by the label texts.

Data columns:

| Col | Field | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | status | `טיוטא` (draft) in all samples; other values are kept as text and reported |
| B | VAT | text number, see signs |
| D | net | text number |
| E | gross | text number |
| F | reference 2 | empty in all samples |
| G | reference 1 | digits or empty (27 of 220 empty) |
| I | details | short supplier name |
| J | counter account | always `כרטיס כללי 0`; ignored |
| L | classification name | the only classification identifier in the file (no code) |
| M | line number | has gaps; display only, never a key |
| N | document date | real date; 64 of 220 fall outside the file's month, which is normal |
| C, H, K | none | empty in data rows |

## Numbers and signs

- Text numbers use `,` as thousands separator and `.` as decimal point: `"1,325.42"`.
- Parentheses mean negative: `"(38.14)"` is `-38.14`. Zero is `"0.00"`.
- Net + VAT = gross in absolute terms on every sample row; VAT is ≈ 18 % of net, or ≈ 11.3 % for 66.67 %-recognised
  items (vehicle, cellular, EV charging), or zero.
- Sign convention is mixed. Do not infer the kind from the sign of one cell:

| Row kind | VAT | net, gross |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expense | negative (parentheses) | positive |
| Credit note on an expense | positive | negative (parentheses) |
| Income (class `הכנסות`) | positive | positive |

- Expense versus income is decided by the classification name `הכנסות`, never by sign.

## Footer

Row numbers below are those of the samples; locate by label.

| Row | Cell | Text | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| last + 1 | `B`, label in `E` `:סה"כ מע"מ לחודש` | number | total VAT = Σ signed column B |
| last + 3 | `I` | `סיכום אריטמטי ללא מע''מ לביקורת : N` | Σ column D, signed |
| last + 3 | `M` | `סיכום אריטמטי כולל מע''מ לביקורת : N` | Σ column E, signed |
| last + 4 | `D`, `I`, `M` | `ת.ציוד כולל : N`, `תשומות כולל : N`, `עסקאות כולל : N` | gross of equipment, inputs, outputs |
| last + 5 | `D`, `I`, `M` | `מע"מ ת.ציוד : N`, `מע"מ תשומות : N`, `מע"מ עסקאות : N` | VAT of equipment, inputs, outputs (positive) |

The label text contains an ASCII `''` (two apostrophes) and variable spaces around `:`. Parse with
`/(.+?)\s*:\s*([\d,.()]+)$/`. The total VAT label is written with the colon first (RTL rendering).

### Checksums

Verified on all six sample files:

1. Σ net (signed) = arithmetic net; Σ gross (signed) = arithmetic gross.
2. Σ signed VAT = total VAT, and total VAT = outputs VAT − inputs VAT − equipment VAT + Σ signed VAT of the rows
   outside the VAT input base. The total is the plain sum of column B, so VAT on such a row (clothing, `ביגוד`) stays
   in it while the inputs line leaves it out. The six samples had no such row; a second client (Oct 2026) did.
3. Outputs gross and VAT = Σ gross and VAT of the income classes (`הכנסות`; another client names it `הכנסה חייבת`).
4. Equipment gross and VAT = Σ of the equipment class (`רכישת ציוד/רכוש קבוע`, code 900).
5. Inputs gross and VAT = Σ over remaining expense rows, **excluding** classes outside the VAT input base
   (`ביטוח עסק`, `ארנונה`), with credit notes subtracting. Zero-VAT rows of other classes (parking) are included.

A footer mismatch is an error shown to the user before import, not a silent warning. Checksums 2, 3 and 5 test the
class types in the chart of accounts. The types depend on the client's Rivhit settings (one client books
`רכב רשוי וביטוח` as an ordinary expense, another keeps it outside the input base), so the chart keeps a default type
per class and optional per-client types (`clientTypes: { clientId: type }`). The import wizard lists every class of
the file with this client's type, re-runs the footer checks (`recheckImport`) on every change, and saves a changed
type of a known class for this client only. When the footer does not add up under the current types, the wizard
searches the class types that make every check pass (`suggestClassTypes`, at most 16 classes, fewest changes from
the current types), preselects them, highlights the changed rows at the top and says so. A suggestion is used only
if `recheckImport` confirms it; the user can still change any type.

## Not in the file

Supplier ID (write `0`), allocation number, image, confidence, agent opinion, raw (pre-recognition) amounts, client
name and tax ID, classification code. Amounts are already recognised: imported rows are stored as source values with
expense 100 % and VAT 100 %, and the business rules (`applyBusinessRule`, codes 806/807/812, home-utility 25 %) are
not run on them.

## Parser output (`telegram-web/excel-journal.js`)

`parseJournalGrid(rows)` returns `{ declarationMonth, rows, footer, errors, warnings }`. A row is
`{ status, vat, net, gross, reference1, reference2, details, classificationName, line, date, kind, sourceRow }` with
money as signed numbers exactly as in the file, rounded to two decimals, `date` as `YYYY-MM-DD`, `kind` one of
`income`, `expense`, `credit`, and `sourceRow` the 1-based sheet row for error messages. `errors` and `warnings` are
`{ code, message, row? | key? }`; any error means the file must not be imported. The class types used by checksum 5
(income, equipment, outside the VAT input base) come from the optional `classTypes` argument, defaulting to the
sample classes until the chart of accounts exists. Rows with a draft status add a
warning that the source transactions were not final.
