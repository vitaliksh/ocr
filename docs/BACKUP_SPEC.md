# Backup store — format and decisions

**Status (4 October 2026): built, pushed and partly verified by Vitalik; the rollout on the real PC is the only required step left.**
Modules (all in `telegram-web/`): `backup-store.js` (format, no DOM), `backup-state.js`, `backup-handles.js`, `backup-ui.js` (the
dialog "גיבוי"), `transfer-store.js` and `transfer-ui.js` (the file "העברה לקובץ"); 279 frontend tests in total. The owner's approval
and the product-boundary exception are in `AGENTS.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.

Background: the data root is the only copy of the data, the bookkeeper's PC sleeps except about 15:00–19:00, and she already has Google
Drive for desktop (mirroring) and copies to a USB flash drive by hand once a month. The owner and the bookkeeper are the only users
(a private tool, not for sale). The app writes **encrypted files into places the user picks**; the sync client, the USB drive or an
e-mail carries them away. The app makes no network call.

**Verified by Vitalik on the published page:** a copy into a Google Drive folder (files appeared there), restore into an empty folder and
opening it, the "העברה לקובץ" export and import (his words: "looks excellent"). **Not reported as checked:** entering an existing code on a
second PC or profile, replacing a saved code, a copy to a USB drive through the dialog (the spike did cover a flash drive), the
automatic copy after locking a declaration, the whole procedure on the bookkeeper's PC.

## What is backed up

Everything under the data root except `clients/<client>/declarations/<month>/images/` and `.../exports/` (heavy, and the paper
originals exist). `createBackup({ images: true, exports: true })` includes them. The store folder itself is never backed up.
Result of a run: `{ name, files, bytes, newBlobs, newBytes, packs, skipped }`; a file that cannot be read goes to `skipped` and
into the snapshot, never silently dropped.

## Layout (inside the picked folder)

~~~text
annateria-backup/
├─ store.json                      plain JSON: format, storeId, keyCheck (a sealed constant that proves the key)
├─ packs/pack-<stamp>-<rand>.bin   sealed blobs back to back (~16 MB each)
├─ packs/pack-<stamp>-<rand>.idx   sealed JSON { blobs: { <sha256>: [offset, length] } }
└─ snapshots/snap-<stamp>-<rand>.bin   sealed JSON { createdAt, options, files: { <path>: { h, s } }, skipped }
~~~

- **Sealed** = `iv (12 bytes) || AES-GCM-256 ciphertext+tag`. Additional data binds a purpose: `annateria-key`, `annateria-index`,
  `annateria-snapshot`, and for a blob its own SHA-256 (a blob moved to another hash fails authentication).
- **Content-addressed:** a blob is named by the SHA-256 of the plain file, so unchanged files are stored once across snapshots.
  File names in the store reveal only backup time; paths and sizes are inside sealed snapshots.
- **Write-once:** no file is ever overwritten or deleted by the app. Order inside a run: pack, its index, then the snapshot file
  (the commit point). An interrupted run leaves unreferenced packs, which are harmless.
- Every write is read back and compared by SHA-256; `InvalidStateError` / `NoModificationAllowedError` are retried (5 times,
  growing pause).
- Key: 256 random bits shown once as the **recovery code** (Crockford base32, 4 check characters, 14 groups of four, e.g.
  `XXXX-…`). `keyFromRecoveryCode` returns a non-extractable `CryptoKey` that the UI can keep in IndexedDB; the code is kept
  on paper by the owners. Lose the code and the backups are unreadable. The snapshot name carries the time, so the last backup
  time is known without the key.

## Operations

`createBackup`, `listSnapshots` (no key needed), `readSnapshot`, `verifyStore({ deep })` (every snapshot opens, every needed blob
exists; deep also decrypts and re-hashes), `restoreSnapshot` (into an **empty** folder, each file checked against its hash),
`snapshotsToKeep` (pure retention list: last 30 days, then the newest of each month for 5 years, newest always kept).
Deleting old snapshots or unreferenced packs is a manual, confirmed action still to build.

## Why it looks like this (spike on 3 October, Edge, Google Drive for desktop and a USB flash drive)

- Overwriting an existing file in the Drive folder failed (2 of 25 rewrites, the Windows "cached interface state" error) → write-once.
- 300 small files (~30 MB) took 56 s in the Drive folder, a single 30 MB file 3.2 s on the flash drive → packs of ~16 MB.
- Removing a folder inside Drive partly failed (311 files removed, 2 refused, folder stayed) → no automatic deletion.
- After restarting Edge the saved folder handle asks for permission again (one click); the non-extractable key survived in
  IndexedDB → the UI starts a backup from a button and shows a status plate.
- AES-GCM plus hashing ran at ~330 MB/s, so encryption is not the bottleneck.
- The data root itself must not be inside a synced folder; only backup files are written there.

## The dialog (sidebar item "גיבוי")

- Two slots with their own folder, "גיבוי עכשיו" and "בדיקת תקינות" (deep verify): `cloud` (a folder inside Google Drive for
  desktop) and `usb` (the monthly flash copy). A folder inside the data root is refused.
- Recovery code: created once, shown once; the key is stored in IndexedDB (non-extractable) only after the user ticks that the code is
  written down and confirms. Restore asks for the code when the key is not on this PC. The same box takes a code from the other PC
  ("שימוש בקוד"); once a key is saved it becomes "החלפת הקוד" and asks for confirmation first (old backups and transfer files need the
  old code). The key survives Ctrl+F5 and a browser restart; only clearing the site data removes it.
- Restore: pick the folder that holds `annateria-backup`, pick a snapshot, pick an empty target folder; then switch the data root to it.
- The sidebar item carries a status dot: green when both slots are fresh, red when the cloud copy is older than 2 days or the
  flash copy older than 35 days, yellow when something was never done.
- `common/backup-state.json` (schema 1) only remembers the last success per slot and `includeImages`; it is part of the data and is
  therefore also inside later copies, so after a restore on another PC it can claim a copy that does not exist there until the first run.
- Triggers: `runAuto("start")` when a data root is opened (only if the cloud copy is older than a day) and `runAuto("lock")` after a
  declaration is locked. Both need a saved key, a cloud folder and an already granted permission; they never ask for permission and
  report only real failures in the status bar. After a browser restart the folder permission is "prompt" again, so the first backup
  of a session is the button.

## Transfer file (sidebar item "העברה לקובץ")

Use case: one owner checks a client's invoices on his PC and hands the result to the other PC, or a whole client moves between the
PCs. One file, `<client>_<MM-YYYY|all>.annateria`, goes by USB drive, e-mail or any folder (a shared Drive folder was tried first and
dropped as impractical). `transfer-store.js` (no DOM) and `transfer-ui.js` (`#transfer-dialog`).

- **Format:** `ANNATERIA-TRANSFER-1
` + sealed (the same AES-GCM sealing and **key** as the backup, so both PCs need the same recovery
  code: "כבר יש לך קוד שחזור" in the backup dialog) of `[4-byte length][JSON meta][image bytes in meta order]`. Meta: kind (`month` or
  `client`), client name/activity/kind, and per month the `declaration.json`, the draft rows, the history lines of a locked month and
  the image list. Without the key nothing is readable; a wrong key, a foreign file and a damaged file give different messages.
- **Export:** choose client and month (or "all months") in the dialog; the entry points preselect them: the "⋯" of a client in the
  sidebar ("ייצוא לקוח לקובץ…"), the "ייצוא" button of a month on the client card, and "ייצוא הצהרה לקובץ…" in the journal's "⋯". Images
  are a checkbox (on for one month, off for all months) with the size shown first; above ~20 MB it warns that e-mail will not take
  it (Gmail sends up to 25 MB, larger files go as a Drive link). The save dialog opens first (it needs the click), then the open
  table is saved if it belongs to the export, then the file is built.
- **Import:** "בחירת קובץ…" reads and decrypts it and shows client, months (open/locked) and counts. The client with the same name is
  preselected; with no match the default is to create the client (after a confirmation). Import only **adds**:
  - a month this PC lacks: an open one is created, a locked one is copied exactly as it was (same declaration id, rows, images and
    its history lines; the history of a declaration is never written twice);
  - an open month here: only rows whose `documentId` is not there yet are appended, their images get the next free numbers
    (`003.jpg` ...), nothing existing is touched; rows whose image was not in the file lose the image reference;
  - a locked month here is never changed (reported as skipped).
  Importing the same file again therefore adds nothing. This is an add-only merge, not a sync: an edit of an existing row does not
  travel. The result lists every month (`created`, `appended`, `copied-locked`, `skipped-locked`). The open table is detached before
  the import and the result opened afterwards (a month, or the client card for a whole client).

## Rollout on the real PC (one time, Vitalik sits with her)

1. Open ANNATERIA and choose the data folder: a **local** folder, not inside Google Drive or OneDrive (a synced active root breaks the
   folder handles).
2. Recovery code: both PCs must hold the **same** code. If a code already exists (Vitalik's PC), enter it in "גיבוי" → "כבר יש לך קוד
   שחזור" → "שימוש בקוד". Only if none exists yet, create one, write it on paper (two copies in two safe places, not on the PC only)
   and confirm. Do not photograph it or send it by chat or mail.
3. Google Drive for desktop must be signed in and mirroring. Create a subfolder inside it (for example `ANNATERIA`; the browser refuses
   the Drive root and system folders), choose it under "Google Drive", press "גיבוי עכשיו", then "בדיקת תקינות" (both must be green).
4. Plug in the flash drive, choose a folder on it under "USB", back up, verify, eject it. The dot in the sidebar turns green when both
   copies are fresh.
5. Restore drill: "שחזור מגיבוי" into a new empty folder (for example `D:estore_test`), pick that folder with "החלפת תיקיית נתונים", check
   that the clients and one report match, then switch back to the working folder.
6. Lock a test declaration and check that a new snapshot appears in the Drive folder without any action.

## Routine

- **Every day:** nothing. The copy into the Drive folder starts by itself when the data folder is opened (if the last one is older than
  a day) and after a declaration is locked, **but only while the browser still holds the folder permission**. After a browser restart
  the first copy of a session is the button "גיבוי עכשיו" (one click on "Allow"). A red dot means the cloud copy is older than 2 days.
- **Once a month:** the flash drive: plug in, "גיבוי" → USB → "גיבוי עכשיו" → "בדיקת תקינות", eject. The dot turns red after 35 days.
- **Every quarter:** "בדיקת תקינות" on both copies. **Once a year:** repeat the restore drill.
- **New PC, lost PC or cleared browser data:** open the page, choose the folders again, enter the recovery code (the key lives only in the
  browser's storage; Ctrl+F5 and a browser restart keep it, clearing the site data removes it), restore from the Drive folder or the
  flash drive. **Without the recovery code the copies cannot be read; there is no way around that.**
- **A wrong code on one PC:** "גיבוי" → enter the right code → "החלפת הקוד" (asks first). New copies then need a new folder.

## Known limits

- Images and legacy exports are not in the copy by default (paper originals exist); rows restored from a copy have no photo, and rows
  without a photo cannot be re-run through Gemini. A checkbox includes them (heavy).
- The transfer file is an **add-only merge**: an edit of an existing row on one PC does not reach the other; rows are matched by
  `documentId`. A locked month is never changed by an import.
- Nothing is ever deleted by the app: old snapshots, packs and transfer files stay until the user removes them by hand. The text data
  are small, so the folders grow slowly. `snapshotsToKeep` (30 days, then one per month for 5 years) exists and is tested but is **not
  wired to a button**; a confirmed manual clean-up is the optional next step.
- Drive for desktop may refuse to delete or overwrite while syncing; the store therefore never does either.
- `common/backup-state.json` is also inside later copies, so after a restore on another PC it may claim a copy that does not exist
  there until the first run.
- Month export is not in the sidebar's month list (those rows have no menu); it is on the client card and in the journal menu.
- The key is per browser profile; two PCs share one code by entering it, there is no key server and no recovery by e-mail.
